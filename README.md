# Django Djitney Train Line Website
## Summary
My third Django project assisted by Codeacedemy as part of the Build Python Web Apps with Django course. The task was to develop website functionality to show, create, update and delete: routes, stations and stops.

- Create class-based views that inheirt generic views to enable users to adapt all models instances'
- Create paths in order to make the site templates accessible
  - Some of the paths included primary keys to adapt particular instances in the models
- Uncomment navigation elements on the base template
